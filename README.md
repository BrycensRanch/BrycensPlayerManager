# BrycensPlayerManager

The Minecraft plugin built to manage your players based off of platform and execute actions based off of player platform and player data.

Made fresh by BrycensRanch, to take a better approach to ofunny's BrycensPlayerManager, which is limited to Spigot and BungeeCord. This is the rewrite that BrycensPlayerManager always needed but sadly never got.

## Goals

Although this project is directly inspired from BrycensPlayerManager, it has different goals at the moment.

- Give permissions and groups based off of platform.
- Filter out potential bad sports, for example, bedrock or java players with a suspiciously low gamerscore or account creation date.
- Have a white-list only SMP? Well, the goal is to have BrycensPlayerManager manage requests to join the SMP via a website and in-game.
- Have the option to remove players that have the same or similar skins,usernames, username matches the configured regex, etc.
- Integration with punishment databases to filter out players that are known to be bad.

## Praise

This project uses JMP’s build logic that has low boilerplate and a universal jar task - I have gone through hell fighting Gradle trying to implement it, but, all credit is given to Jmp. https://github.com/jpenilla/MiniMOTD/blob/v2.0.8/universal/build.gradle.kts Licensed under MIT, so, it’s compatible with our project.
